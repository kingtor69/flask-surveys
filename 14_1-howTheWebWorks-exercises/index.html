                        <li><b>GET</b> is a request from user to server which does not change any information on the server. The GET request directs the server towards requested information and the format in which the user is expecting to a response.</li>
                        <li><b>POST</b> is a request from user which is intended to change information on the server (generally adding it, as a social media post). In addition to the information to be added, the POST request includes information about the format of the POSTed information as well as expectations of response from the server.</li>

                    An HTTP header is a widget of the information in a request or response which consists of a key and value with the key being what kind of information is included and the value being that information. Examples:
