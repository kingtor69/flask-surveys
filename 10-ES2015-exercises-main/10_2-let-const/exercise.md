# let and const exercise
- What is the difference between var and let?
    - var doesn't work as well as let for modern programming ;)
    - on the serious, var is declared at the window level in situations where let is declared globally, but does not appear in the window object
    - hoisting:
        - var is "hoisted" meaning the declaration **behaves** as though it were made at the beginning of the code
        - let is not hoisted and references made to it earlier in the code than the declaration yield and error
    - scope:
        - var is scoped at the function level, which means a declation/assignment made within an *if () {}* statment can also be used outside that statement
        - let is scoped at the block level, which means that same declation only exists within the *if () {}* statment (also true of *for (let i=0; i&lt;something; i++){}* loops, which is one good reason to use let instead of var)
    - var can be re-declared as many times as you want, whereas let can only be declared once (per block)
- What is the difference between var and const?
    - they are pretty much the same as the differences between var and let
- What is the difference between let and const?
    - let can be re-assigned, whereas const can not.
    - scoping & hoisting are the same for both let and const
- What is hoisting?
    - stupid ;)
    - no, seriously, a "hoisted" variable **behaves** as though it were made at the beginning of the code, meaning references made to it before the declaration yield undefined rather than throwing an error
